How to run the simulations:

1- Download and unzip the file called "latest simulations"

2- Anaconda (python environment development) is highly suggest

3- Launch jupyter lab, choose the navigator

4- locate "latest simulations" on your computer , open and find the file called "sim.ipyn"
and click on it in the anaconda browser.

5- specify the precision of your choice and run the code .

You can find the plot for each patient in the "latest simulations" folder with a name like
"comparison_precision_X" where X corresponds to the comparison_precision_X

To add more patient data, all you need is to add new arrays in the file called
input_arrays.text. The array must be a python array, ideally, we specify the patient number
to make the analysis easier
